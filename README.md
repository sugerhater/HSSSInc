#Code Refactor
 
## Description
 
This Repository is for the first homework I did on my way to become a full stack developer and it is called "Code Refactor". We received an HTML file and a CSS file inspected it and used the knowledge we learned in the first week to improve the 2 files. I improved the codes in HTML and CSS file so that: 
        HTML codes are not semantic;
        More semantic tags are used so it is not well structured;
        Some minor errors that do not have a huge impact on the function of HTML are fixed;
        Comments are made to help me and people who will view the file.
 
Also, for CSS file:
        Classes that are identical but with different names are combined into one class;
        The structure of the CSS file follows the same order as the HTML file.
        Like the HTML file, comments are made so the CSS file is more readable.
